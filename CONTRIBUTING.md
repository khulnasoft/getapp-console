```

## Development

### 1. Clone the repository with git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khulnasoft/getapp-console.git getapp-console
```

### 2. Install dependencies with npm

Navigate to the GetApp Console repository and install dependencies.

```bash
cd getapp-console && pnpm install
```

### 3. Install and run GetApp locally

When you run the GetApp Console locally, it needs to point to a backend as well. The easiest way to do this is to run an GetApp instance locally.

Follow the [install instructions](https://getapp.khulnasoft.com/docs/advanced/self-hosting) in the GetApp docs.

### 4. Setup environment variables

Add a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` file as a template in the project's root directory.

> **Note**
> If you are updating from GetApp `1.5.x`, be aware that the variables for the console in the `.env` / `.env.example` file have changed in `1.6.x`.

Finally, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

> **Note**
> If http://localhost:3000 is blank and the browser console logs have a `TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: http://localhost:3000/.svelte-kit/generated/nodes/0.js` error, try to turn off any ad blocker you have and reload the page ([reference](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3308#issuecomment-1149942109)).

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.

### Tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

This will run tests in the `tests/` directory.

### Format

Code should be consistently formatted everywhere. Before committing code, run the code-formatter.

```bash
pnpm run format
```

### Linter

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

### Diagnostics

Diagnostic tool that checks for the following:

-   Unused CSS
-   Svelte A11y hints
-   TypeScript compiler errors

```bash
pnpm run check
```

## Submit a Pull Request üöÄ

The branch naming convention is as follows

`TYPE-ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION`

example:

```
doc-548-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide
```

When `TYPE` can be:

-   **feat** - is a new feature
-   **doc** - documentation only changes
-   **cicd** - changes related to CI/CD system
-   **fix** - a bug fix
-   **refactor** - code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

**All PRs must include a commit message with a description of the changes made!**

Start by forking the project and use the `git clone` command to download the repository to your computer. A standard procedure for working on an issue would be to:

1. Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream to make sure your default branch is up to date.

```
$ git pull
```

2. Create a new branch from the default branch. For example `doc-548-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide`

```
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

3. Work - commit - repeat ( be sure to be in your branch )
4. Push changes to GitHub

```
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

6. Submit your changes for review. If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
7. Start a Pull Request (PR) by clicking on `Create pull request`. Make sure to update the PR description following the template provided.
8. Wait for a code review.
9. If you need to make changes based on feedback, make sure to re-request a review from your reviewer after you've made the necessary changes.

![Re-Request a Review](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-4714/images/help/pull_requests/request-re-review.png)

10. After approval, your PR will be merged.
11. You can delete your branch after it has been merged.

## Guidelines

### Consistency

Before committing always make sure to run all available tools to improve the codebase:

-   Formatter
    -   `pnpm run format`
-   Tests
    -   `pnpm test`
-   Diagnostics
    -   `pnpm run check`

### Performance

Page load times are a key consideration for users of all browsers and device types.

There are some general things we can do in front-end development:

-   Minimize HTTP requests
-   Minimize blocking ‚Äì content should be readable before client-side processing
-   Lazy load "supplementary" content, especially images

### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

If you repeat anything that has already been defined in code, refactor it so that it only ever has one representation in the codebase.

If you stick to this principle, you will ensure that you will only ever need to change one implementation of a feature without worrying about the need to change any other part of the code.

### Separation of concerns

Separate _structure_ from _presentation_ from _behavior_ to aid maintainability and understanding.

-   Keep CSS (presentation), JS (behavior) and HTML (structure) in the same respective Svelte component
-   Avoid writing inline CSS or Javascript in HTML
-   Avoid writing CSS or HTML in Javascript
-   Don't choose HTML elements to imply style
-   Where appropriate, use CSS or Svelte rather than Javascript for animations and transitions
-   Try to use templates when defining markup in Javascript

### Write code to be read

Follow the principles of ['Keep It Simple, Stupid'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) (KISS); hard-to-read or obfuscated code is difficult to maintain and debug. Don't be too clever; write code to be read.

### Identify technical debt

Use code comment annotations (`@todo`) to mark parts of your code that require further work. This will allow the measurement and management of technical debt.

Don't use `@fixme`, which defines things that are broken. Don't commit broken code in to the repo.

### Dependencies

Please avoid introducing new dependencies to GetApp without consulting the team. New dependencies can be very helpful, but they also introduce new security and privacy issues, complexity, and impact total docker image size.

Adding a new dependency should contribute vital value to the product with minimum possible risk.

## Introducing New Features

We would üíñ you to contribute to GetApp, but we also want to ensure GetApp is loyal to its vision and mission statement üôè.

For us to find the right balance, please open an issue explaining your ideas before introducing a new pull request.

This will allow the GetApp community to sufficiently discuss the new feature value and how it fits within the product roadmap and vision.

This is also important for the GetApp lead developers to be able to provide technical input and potentially a different emphasis regarding the feature design and architecture. Some bigger features might need to go through our [RFC process](https://github.com/appwrite/rfc).

## Other Ways to Help

Pull requests are great, but there are many other areas where you can help GetApp.

### Blogging & Speaking

When blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials about one of GetApp's many features, mention [@appwrite](https://twitter.com/khulnasoft) on Twitter and/or email [team@getapp.khulnasoft.com](mailto:team@getapp.khulnasoft.com) so we can give pointers and tips and help you spread the word by promoting your content on the different GetApp communication channels. Please add your blog posts and videos of talks to our [Awesome GetApp](https://github.com/appwrite/awesome-appwrite) repo on GitHub.

### Presenting at Meetups

Presenting at meetups and conferences about your GetApp projects is another excellent way to get the word out about GetApp. Your unique challenges and successes in building things with GetApp can provide great speaking material. We'd love to review your talk abstract/CFP, so get in touch with us if you'd like some help!

### Sending Feedback & Reporting Bugs

Sending feedback is an excellent way for us to understand different use cases for GetApp. If you have any issues or want to share your experience, feel free to do so on our GitHub issues page or our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/GSeTUeA).

### Submitting New Ideas

If you think GetApp could use a new feature, please open an issue on our GitHub repository, stating as much information as you can think about your new idea and its implications. We would also use this issue to gather more information, get more feedback from the community, and have a proper discussion about the new feature.

### Improving Documentation

Submitting documentation updates, enhancements, designs, or bug fixes help us to improve our documentation. Spelling or grammar fixes are also very much appreciated.

### Helping Someone

You can also help by teaching others how to contribute to GetApp's repo! Please consider searching for GetApp on Discord, GitHub, or StackOverflow and helping someone else who needs help.

## Code of Conduct

Help us keep GetApp open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/khulnasoft/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
